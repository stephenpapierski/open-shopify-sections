# Open Shopify Sections

**Stop paying for blocks. Start using open ones.**

A growing collection of free and open-source Shopify sections you can drop straight into your theme.
All sections are designed and tested on Shopifyâ€™s **Dawn** theme, but they should work in most **2.0 themes** as well (though your mileage may vary).

MIT-licensed, no subscriptions, no hidden upsells â€” just clean Liquid, CSS, and JSON you can tweak however you like.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Free & Open Source** â€“ MIT license, modify and share as you please.
* **Tested on Dawn** â€“ works out of the box with Shopifyâ€™s default 2.0 theme.
* **Plug-and-Play** â€“ copy, paste, and customize in minutes.
* **Growing Library** â€“ new sections (hopefully) added regularly.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside

Each section is a **single `.liquid` file** containing:

* The sectionâ€™s HTML/Liquid markup
* Its schema for Theme Editor settings
* Scoped CSS for styling

Everything you need is self-contained.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Copy the `.liquid` file from the repo into your themeâ€™s `/sections` directory.
2. Open the Theme Editor and add the section where you want it.
3. Customize settings (like heading, colors, spacing, alignment, etc.) directly in the editor.
