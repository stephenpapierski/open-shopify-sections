# Open Shopify Sections

**Stop paying for blocks. Start using open ones.**  

A growing collection of free and open-source Shopify sections you can drop straight into your theme.  
All sections are designed and tested on Shopifyâ€™s **Dawn** theme, but theyâ€™ll likely work in other themes too (your mileage may vary).  

MIT-licensed, no subscriptions, no hidden upsells â€” just clean Liquid, CSS, and JSON you can tweak however you like.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Free & Open Source** â€“ MIT license, modify and share as you please.  
- **Tested on Dawn** â€“ works out of the box with Shopifyâ€™s default theme.  
- **Plug-and-Play** â€“ copy, paste, and customize in minutes.  
- **Growing Library** â€“ more sections added over time.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside
Each section includes:
- A `.liquid` file (the section itself)  
- JSON schema for settings & customization in the Theme Editor  
- Lightweight CSS scoped to the section

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Copy the `.liquid` file from the repo into your themeâ€™s `/sections` directory.  
2. Open the Theme Editor and add the section where you want it.  
3. Customize settings (like heading, colors, spacing, or alignment) directly in the editor.
